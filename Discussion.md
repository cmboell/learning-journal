# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?
*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. It uses textual symbols to indicate structure of a page. It is a simple and easy way to code. Markdown is written in plain text, so it is easy to read because it uses real words and characters. Markdown **is not** written like you would write a Word Doc, but it is similar. Instead of using buttons at the top of the Word Doc, you use symbols to tell the code on what effects to create.
*Here are some examples:*
- `#, ##, ###` are used for headers
-`** ** or __ __` can be used to make words **bold**
-`* * or _ _`can be used to words *italic*
(note: `*`=asterik,`_`=underscore, `-`=hyphen or a single dash)

Markdown is a verily easy to learn. However, it does take a little bit of practice and memorization skills. Github is the perfect place to learn how to use markdown. You just need to start a new repository. Remember that when a file is written with markdown it will end in **.md**.
