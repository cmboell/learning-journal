## Choosing a Text Editor
The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as a web developer. It is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer or access online. It allows you write and  manage text.
**Features You Should Look For**
- code completion ( this will display possible suggestions on what you already typed)
- syntax highlighting (will make text more noticeable by highlighting the text)
- a nice variety of themes (will allow you to do various things such as change color of background, series of color in your text, etc.)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
*There area many text editors to choose from*
**The Difference Between Text Editor And IDE**

It also manages text, and manages files. 
An *IDE (Integrated Development Environment)* is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


##The Command Line
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The command line will present you with a prompt. After you type it will display after you complete the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
*Here are some examples of commands you can use*
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- mkdir
- touch
